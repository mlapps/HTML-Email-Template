            Dear Colleagues <br> <br>
            Metrological has had a fantastic growth in the last few years thanks to the continued efforts
                of every one of you working in your respective teams. 
                As we look to the future with confidence, 
                we in the SDK Support team have set out to make sure we have the proper infrastructure 
                and procedures in place to scale our operations as needed. During our analysis, 
                we concluded that we need to adjust the channels we use to communicate with our customers and external parties. 
                Some of you already know these changes are coming, but we would like to take this opportunity to make it official.
        </p>                            
    </div>
    
    <div class="outer hero" style="background-color: #FEF0D8;position: relative;width: 100%;display: flex;background-image: url(images/Metrological-PNG-Web\ 2.png);background-size: contain;background-repeat: no-repeat;background-position: bottom;margin: 0 auto;max-width: 600px;border-spacing: 0;font-family: roboto;color: #000000;">
        <p style="padding: 50px;text-align: justify;">
            From this point forward, we want to make sure all new SDK Support communication comes through JIRA, 
            via our <a href="https://metrological.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/1" style="text-decoration: none;color: #000000;font-weight: bold;">Metrological SDK Support Help Desk</a>. This will help us increase transparency within the organization 
            and better distribute our work load. It will remove dependencies on individual support engineers who now need to check e-mail, 
            Slack, Skype and many other disparate communication channels to confirm they have not missed queries. 
            Most importantly, it will help us provide a quicker, and overall fairer, experience to all the customers and 
            external parties who reach out to us, thus leading to increased customer satisfaction.
        </p>
    </div>
    

    <div class="outer" style="margin: 0 auto;width: 100%;max-width: 600px;border-spacing: 0;font-family: roboto;color: #000000;">
        <p style="padding: 50px;text-align: justify;">
            We understand that sometimes customers want to talk to us in Slack or Skype for quick, 
            rapid-fire communication - we will continue to provide that service for selected customers only. 
            In all other cases, we will invite external development teams to join the <a href="https://lightning-community.slack.com/join/shared_invite/zt-f0khi0lt-OXNrRqCfmEWX7jx3F6GaTw#/shared-invite/email" style="text-decoration: none;color: #000000;font-weight: bold;">Lightning Community Slack group</a> 
            and take part in the conversation, together. There, questions can be answered by any member of the community, 
            including Metrological app developers, platform developers and Lightning core team members.
        </p>

        <p style="padding: 50px;text-align: justify;">
            While this change can be scary, we want to assure you that we will continue to work with the same dedication 
            and personalisation as we have always done. We will continue to setup calls with our customers and provide 
            them step-by-step solutions. We will continue to work with you, our colleagues, in a direct manner to make 
            sure we provide appropriate guidance to our customers. That is what we do best, and this is what we want to focus 
            on now that we will not have to juggle so many communication channels.
        </p>
